To gain a foundation in AI techniques, you will implement classical solution methods, define Markov decision processes, policies, and value functions, and derive Bellman equations. Then, you will learn dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, temporal-difference methods, and deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) and apply these techniques to solve real-world problems. You will train agents to navigate virtual worlds, generate optimal financial trading strategies, and apply RL to multiple interacting agents.","title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning","updated_at":1732954936,"version":"4.0.15"},{"_highlightResult":{"skill_names":[{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"AI algorithms in Python"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Adjusting for corporate actions"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Alpha generation"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Alpha research"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Alpha signals"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Anaconda"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Arima"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Arma"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Backpropagation"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Backtesting"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Bag of words"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Cvxpy"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data ingestion"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data pre-processing"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data scraping"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Decision trees"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Etfs"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Factor investing"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Feature engineering"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Feature importance calculation"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Financial indices"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Financial portfolio optimization"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Financial portfolio risk models"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Financial portfolio theory"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Financial trading"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Garch models"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Glove"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Gradient descent"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Investment performance attribution"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Jupyter notebooks"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Kalman filters"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Model performance metrics"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"NLP for finance"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"NLP pipelines"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"NumPy"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Outlier analysis"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Overfitting prevention"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Pandas"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Particle filters"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"PyTorch"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Python package management"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Quant workflow"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Random forest models"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Recurrent neural networks"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Return calculation"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Sentiment analysis"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Sequential data analysis"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Statistical regression"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Stock return factor models"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Text generation"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Text pre-processing"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Tf-idf"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Time-series analysis with ML"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Training neural networks"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Volatility clustering"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Word embeddings"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Word2vec"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"matplotlib"}],"summary":{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Complete real-world projects designed by industry experts, covering topics from asset management to trading signal generation.

Your final project is based on a real-world scenario that will require you to think like an architect and build an end-to-end data lake system proposal.","title":"Big Data Systems","updated_at":1730829766,"version":"3.0.12"},{"_highlightResult":{"skill_names":[{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Conceptual erds"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data cleaning"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data governance business context"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data governance fluency"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data profiling"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Data quality assessment"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Enterprise data models"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Logical erds"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Master data management"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Metadata management"},{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"Metadata management systems"}],"summary":{"matchLevel":"none","matchedWords":[],"value":"In this course, you will learn how to design a data governance solution that meets your company’s needs.
